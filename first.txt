Because SonarQube uses an embedded Elasticsearch, make sure that your Docker host configuration complies with the Elasticsearch production mode requirements and File Descriptors configuration.

For example, on Linux, you can set the recommended values for the current session by running the following commands as root on the host:

sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=524288
sysctl -w fs.file-max=131072
ulimit -n 131072
ulimit -u 8192
